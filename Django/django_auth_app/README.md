Develop basic user application | Django Week 2
This is a follow-up ticket to https://edlyio.atlassian.net/browse/EDLY-3417. In this ticket, we are going to implement the basic Django concepts learned into a form of an application.

Acceptance criteria:

Django application with Django form, authentication (Signup, Login, Logout, Edit Profile, Password Change).

Use custom Django templates and proper validation and exception handlings.

Add custom user model, custom authentication Middleware, auto-generated fields in the user Model that will be generated automatically on the save method call.

Pep-8 conventions should be followed in the code.
